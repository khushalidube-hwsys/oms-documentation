# Reset Inventory API

Syncs inventory from an external reference source to HotWax. After receiving the inventory file in CSV format, HotWax Commerce calculates the difference in inventory and matches its inventory levels exactly with CSV. CSV files can be imported in HotWax by two methods: using the EXIM menu in HotWax or saving the file at a designated SFTP location for HotWax to automatically download and process.

Sample path for SFTP method: `/home/<host_name>-sftp/staging/incoming` 

## CSV example

Here's an example of the CSV file format:

| facilityId       | locationSeqId | idType           | idValue       | availableQty | 
|------------------|---------------|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| DEMO_HC_STORE_1  | TLTLTLLL01    | sku              | WH09-XL-Green | 20           |
